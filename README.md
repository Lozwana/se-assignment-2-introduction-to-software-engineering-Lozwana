Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is a branch of computer science that is concerned with the conception, design, testing, implementation, and maintenance of software programmes and systems.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Traditional programming focuses solely on writing code and debugging errors in programmes. It solely participates in the design, testing, and maintenance stages of the Software Development Life Cycle, whereas software engineering is involved in all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle. Software engineers develop software solutions for the company's clients.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1. Planning- Defining software's purporse.
2. Requirements gathering- Gathering users requiements.
3. Design- Developing an in depth software design, encompassing architecture and user interface.
4. Implementation- Writing coding.
5. Testing- Checking usability.
6. Deployment- Releasing the product to users.
7. Maintanance- Repairing and updating code.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Waterfall Sofware Developmemt Life Cycle model has phases and each one falls into the next. This model requires proper planning for it to work seamlessly. It's for a software solution with fixed needs. Agile is the most popular model. It has gradually implemented sprints that allow for flexibility. Unlike the waterfall model this model requires minimum planning and is suitable for programs that have changing needs. 


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system (geeksforgeeks, April 2024, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-requirements-engineering-process/). It ensure the successful development of a software product in timeously.



Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity is a process of breaking down complicate programmes for better understanding. Modularity makes code more organised and ensures changes can be easly applied without affecting the entire program.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
1. unit testing- ensure that each component of the software functions as intended. 
2. integration testing- ensures that individual parts of code function together properly when combined
3. system testing- checks the entire software system to ensure that it meets defined requirements and performs well in the intended environment
4. acceptance testing- Acceptance testing, often known as user acceptance testing (UAT), is the process of testing software from the perspective of end users to ensure that it satisfies their needs and expectations. 
Testing is important because it helps identify bugs, ensures quality and user satisfaction.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control systems serve as a code storage facility, tracking changes made to a code while also allowing for seamless communication between developers. The most popular version control system is GitHub.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Software project managers are responsible for the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Responsibilities:
1. Project Planning and Scheduling
2. Stakeholder Communication
3. Risk Management
4. Quality Assurance
5. Team Leadership

Challenges:
 1. Resource Constraints
 2. Technical Complexity
 3. Time Management
 4. Communication Issues
 5. Stakeholder Management

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance is the process of upgrading, updating, and enhancing existing software programmes in order to address faults, improve performance, adapt to new requirements, and assure continuous relevance and usefulness over time. There are many types of maintenance activities:
1. Corrective Maintenance- Bug fixing
2. Adaptive Maintenance- To modifying the software to accommodate changes in the environment. Example, updates to operating systems.
3. Perfective Maintenance- To enhance the software to improve its performance, efficiency, usability, or functionality based on user feedback.
4. Preventive Maintenance- To address potential issues before they manifest as problems.
Maintanance is an important part of SDLC because it ensures the longevity, reliability, and effectiveness of software systems. 

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Software engineers could face a variety of ethical challenges during their careers, including privacy and data protection, security, and unconscious bias. To ensure they adhere to ethical standards Software engineers can try to be aware of their own biases, stay up to date with the country's data and privacy regulations and proactively identify and address ethical concerns during requirements gathering, design, implementation, and testing phases.
